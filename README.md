Complexity

# Definition
> << ... about complexity science, which is an interdisciplinary field—at the intersection of mathematics, computer science and natural science—that focuses on discrete models of physical systems. In particular, it focuses on complex systems, which are systems with many interacting components. ... >> - [Think Complexity Book](http://greenteapress.com/complexity/html/index.html)

> Complexity characterises the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity)

[**Complexity: A Guided Tour**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199798109/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0199798109&linkCode=as2&tag=jepemolinks-20&linkId=425bcd3ff350748f2bb13e85663a4920) by [Melanie Mitchell](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=k4gbv2AAAAAJ&hl=ca&oi=ao) - Tour of the sciences of complexity, a broad set of efforts that seek to explain how large-scale complex, organized, and adaptive behavior can emerge from simple interactions among myriad individuals.

[**Think Complexity: Complexity Science and Computational Modeling**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492040207?ie=UTF8&tag=jepemolinks-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=1492040207) by [Allen Downey](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=GxBFR3sAAAAJ&hl=ca&oi=ao) - Introduction to complexity where you’ll use graphs, cellular automata, and agent-based models to study topics in physics, biology, and economics, using Python as a programming language.

[**Chaos: Making a New Science**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143113453?ie=UTF8&tag=jepemolinks-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0143113453) by [James Gleick](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gleick) - Describes the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and Lorenz attractors without using complicated mathematics. It portrays the efforts of dozens of scientists whose separate work contributed to the developing field. The text remains in print and is widely used as an introduction to the topic for the mathematical layperson.
